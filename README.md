# Brain Tumor Detection — CNN (PyTorch) Served with FastAPI

This project demonstrates how to **serve a trained CNN brain-tumor detection model** using **PyTorch** and **FastAPI**.

> **Project Focus**
>
> This repository focuses on **deploying and serving the model smoothly with FastAPI**.  
> **Training is not important here** — it is optional and only mentioned for reference.
